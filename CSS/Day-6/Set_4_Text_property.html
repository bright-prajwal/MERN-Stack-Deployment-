      Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
      scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
      the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated
      March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly
      after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero
      team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron
      Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published
      consistently since the character's creation.

    <h3>Permiere</h3>
    <p class="bolder">
      Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent
      revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics
      created new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial concept
      for Iron Man.

      Michelinie and Layton remained on the series until Iron Man #153
      (1981).[46] Michelinie later said, "The reason I quit is that we felt we'd
      done everything with it that we'd set out to do."[47] Through the 1980s,
      writers for Iron Man focused on the character's role as a businessman,
      reflecting the economic changes associated with Reaganomics, and many of
      his challenges involved threats to his company.[48] Denny O'Neil was put
      in charge of Iron Man beginning with issue #158 (1982).
